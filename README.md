# Second Brain 🧠

Second Brain is a personal knowledge management system designed to help users save and organize important links, documents, and resources in one secure place.

## 🚀 Purpose

We often save valuable YouTube videos, blog posts, Twitter threads, GitHub repos, and documents — but forget where we stored them later.

Second Brain solves this problem by allowing users to:
- Save important links and resources
- Add tags for better organization
- Quickly search and filter saved content
- Access everything from one centralized dashboard

## 🏗 How It Works

1. Users register and log in securely.
2. They can add links or content with optional tags.
3. The system stores the data in a structured database.
4. Users can view, filter, and manage their saved resources anytime.

- JWT Authentication

**Frontend**

## 🎯 Goal

To build a simple, fast, and secure system that acts as your digital memory — so you never lose valuable resources again.
